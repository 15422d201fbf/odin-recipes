        <li> A lot of salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li> Start by boiling a pot 2/3s full with water on medium heat.</li>
        <li> While the water is boiling, grate the pecorino inside a bowl, reserve in the fridge.</li>
        <li> Cut the guanciale into medium sized bits. You can make them thiner if you prefer, then reserve at room temp.</li>
        <li> Crack 1 egg inside a bowl, and crack the other one and only add the yolk inside that same bowl. </li>
        <li> Add in the pecorino you grated earlier with the eggs, stir and add the crushed black pepper.</li>
        <li> By now, the water should already be boiling. Put a lot of salt inside the water, add the pasta and cook them accordingly to the package instructions.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, put the guanciale in a cold pan, then turn it on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li> Once the pasta finishes cooking, take a ladle and pour a little bit of pasta water inside the pan with the guanciale. It's gonna be sizzling, so reduce the heat a bit. </li>
        <li> Keep a bit of pasta water inside a container, drain the pasta with a strainer and pour them directly on the pan.</li>
        <li> Mix and cook for 30 seconds. Then immediatly cut the heat and add your egg mixture.</li>
        <li> Mix until it gets creamy, if it's too mushy then add some pasta water again to loosen it up.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your food ! Remember, the longer you wait, the colder it gets and the less creamy the sauce will be.</li>
    </ol>
