    <h2> Ingredients (for 4-5 pers)</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 kg of russet potatoes</li>
        <li> 250g of butter (usually just 1/4th of the potatoes' weight but you can put less if you desire)</li>
        <li> Some nutmeg powder</li>
        <li> 10cl of whole milk (1/10th of the potatoes' weight but you can put more or less if you desire)</li>
        <li> Coarse salt</li>
        <li> Crushed black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li> Start first by putting the butter at room temperature so it's easier to cut.</li>
        <li> Boil some water in a big pot. (around 1/2 of the pot)</li>
        <li> Peel the potatoes and cut them in quarters.</li>
        <li> Once the water boils, put some coarse salt inside the water and put your potatoes in.</li>
        <li> The secret is to boil them until you feel like they are going to break apart. You can test if they are ready by forking them every 5 minutes, and if the potato falls easily of the fork then it's ready to be drained.</li>
        <li>Once they are drained, mash them with the adequate tool.</li>
        <li> Cut the butter into small cubes.</li>
        <li> Heat the pot back up again to low heat and immediatly pour in your potatoes. Add the butter slowly until all is mixed.</li>
        <li> Then, add your milk in slowly while you mix. Add more to your desiring.</li>
        <li> Add a dash of nutmeg powder (this thing has very strong taste so make sure you taste before adding more)</li>
        <li> Finally, add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li> Chef Robuchon does this very famous presentation thing with his puree and makes it go through a mesh but we aren't going to bother with that. You can search online if you want to do that.</li>
        <li> Add some coarse salt in the plate and enjoy !</li>
    </ol>
